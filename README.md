📊 Email Metric Analysis

This project focuses on evaluating the performance of an email newsletter mock-up for Zero, analyzing key metrics such as open rates, click-through rates, and conversion rates.

Through deep research, I explored audience engagement patterns and identified improvement opportunities. I utilized ChatGPT and Perplexity AI to interpret data insights and refine the overall analysis approach. Additionally, I reviewed Zero’s social media platforms to better understand the brand’s business identity and audience behavior.

The findings helped develop actionable recommendations to improve future email performance and campaign effectiveness.
